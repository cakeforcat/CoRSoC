This may be achieved by a mix of techniques, and machine-learning (ML) based techniques are increasing in popularity. \n",

To avoid introducing bottlenecks on the network, the DNN implementation must be capable of detecting malicious ones at line rate, which can be millions of packets per second, and is expected to increase further as next-generation networking solutions provide increased\n",

Even though we want the final output of our MLP to be a binary (0/1) value indicating the classification, we've only defined a single-neuron FC layer as the output. While training the network we'll pass that output through a sigmoid function as part of the loss criterion, which [gives better numerical stability](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss.html). Later on, after we're done training the network, we'll add a quantization node at the end before we export it to FINN."

QONNX is the format we can export from Brevitas, to feed it into the FINN compiler, we will need to make a conversion to the FINN-ONNX format which is the intermediate representation the compiler works on. The conversion of the FINN-ONNX format is a FINN compiler transformation and to be able to apply it to our model, we will need to wrap it into [ModelWrapper](https://finn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals.html#modelwrapper). This is a wrapper around the ONNX model which provides several helper functions to make it easier to work with the model. Then we can call the conversion function to obtain the model in FINN-ONNX format."
